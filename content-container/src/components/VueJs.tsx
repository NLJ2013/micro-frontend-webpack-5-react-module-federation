      Vue.js (or simply Vue) is a lightweight, JavaScript framework for building
      reactive web user interfaces. Vue extends standard HTML and CSS to create
      a suite of powerful tools for building the front end of interactive web
      applications. Operating within the model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) framework,
      the main library of Vue focuses on the viewmodel layer, providing reactive
      synchronization between the model and view layers via two-way data
      binding. This simplifies the creation of modern web apps based on the
      single-page application (SPA) model
    </div>
